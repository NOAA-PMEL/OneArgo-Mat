RELEASE NOTES FOR USERS OF THE OneArgo-Mat TOOLBOX

Version 1.1.0 (April 2025)

This version includes a variety of new features:
Archived snapshots of Argo data can be used instead of "live" data
from the Global Data Assembly Centers (GDACs).
Map plots (lon/lat axes at any depth) can be created.
Plotting routines can be called with previously loaded Data structs.
The data2table function allows the creation of a standard Matlab
table to hold all data from the two-level Data struct.
Many functions have new options, and some bugs were fixed.

Version 1.0.3

This version includes two bug fixes:
Previously, the overall maximum time for time series plots for 
multiple floats was incorrect.
For profile and time series plots with a second variable in adjusted
mode, an error occurred in the creation of the variable name for
the adjusted data.


Version 1.0.2 / 1.0.1

This version is almost identical to version 1.3 of the BGC-Argo-Mat
toolbox (described below). The only change is that the assigned setting
of Settings.default_type in initialize_argo was changed from
'bgc' to 'all', and the header was adapted to OneArgo-Mat.

RELEASE NOTES FOR USERS OF THE BGC_ARGO_MAT TOOLBOX

Version 1.3

This version expands access to all Argo float data. The select_profiles
function now has an additional optional argument 'type', whose value can
be set to either 'bgc', 'phys' (core and deep),  or 'all'.
If the type is not specified, but sensors are, the type will be set
to 'bgc' if sensors other than pressure, temperature, and/or salinity are
selected. In all other cases the default type is Settings.default_type,
which is set in initialize_argo ('bgc' by default).

Previously written scripts that use select_profiles calls that implicitly
assume BGC only floats (but not specify BGC sensors) should either have
Settings.default_type set to 'bgc' or have 'type','bgc' added to
the calls to the select_profiles function.

In previous versions, all floats that are listed in the Sprof index
file were considered BGC floats. However, there are (183, as of
April 2022) floats that are listed in the Sprof index file, but
have only physical (pressure, temperature, salinity) sensors. These
will now be labeled as physical floats.

For BGC floats, only Sprof (not prof) files will be downloaded and used,
even if only physical variables (p, T, S) are currently used for plots etc.

Note that there is no distinction between core and deep floats in the
index files. Therefore, if a search for deep floats is conducted,
an appropriate depth value must be specified as an argument to the
select_profiles function (>2000 dbar).

New functions download_tech_files and download_traj_files download
*tech.nc and *traj files from the GDAC. Extraction of information
from these files must be performed outside of the toolbox.

Version 1.2

The select_profiles function can now be called with additional
optional selection criteria: The DAC (data access center responsible
for a float), multiple sensors, a minimum number of profiles matching
all other search criteria, and a list of floats that must match the
other specified criteria.

Functions select_profiles, load_float_data, and show_trajectories
will now all interpolate missing positions (marked with value 9
in the POSITION_QC field) if possible from surrounding good
postition values. This can be suppressed by adding option
'interp_lonlat','no' to these function calls. Note that the
values in the Sprof file are not modified by this interpolation.
For trajectory plots, estimated positions (either done by the
toolbox or if the POSITION_QC value in the Sprof file is 8)
can be marked in gray (or another color, set in initialize_argo).

This version adds a new type of plot (time series) that can be used
either per float or with multiple floats in one plot. If it is used
to plot each float's time series separately, a second variable can
be plotted for comparison.

For profile plots a second variable can be shown for comparison.
(NOTE that this feature requires Matlab R2019b or later if the
two variables are of different types, e.g., 'DOXY' and 'NITRATE'.
Two variables of the same type, e.g., 'DOXY' and 'DOXY2' can
be plotted with R2016b or later.)
The color scheme for profile plots was modified and can now be
easily adjusted by changing the default values in initialize_argo.
A depth range can now be specified.

For section plots start and end date as well as a depth range
can now be spcecified.

New options are available for trajectory plots: lines between
profiles, size of the markers for profiles, and the legend can be
suppressed.

The tutorial script was renamed to Tutorial.m, and several other
scripts were added to show additional features:
Comp_doxy_doxy2.m
Show_deep_floats.m
Show_doxy_rmode.m
Show_missing_lonlat.m
Show_under_ice.m

initialize_argo will now add sensors that were not listed in the code
but were found in the index file.

New function list_sensors shows either all available sensors across
the fleet of all floats or the sensors that are available on all
of the specified floats.

New function download_meta_files downloads *meta.nc files from the
GDAC. Extraction of information from these files must be performed
outside of the toolbox.

Auxiliary variables (density and mixed layer depth) will now be based
on raw pressure, temperature, and salinity if the underlying plot
uses raw variables. Potential density instead of in situ density
is used now.


Version 1.1 (December 1, 2021)

The most important change since version 1.0 regards the evaluation of
the index file (argo_synthetic-profile_index.txt). Previously, its
information was used to determine the number of profiles for each float
and the availability of sensors. Now it is only used for an initial
selection of potential floats. Then the matching Sprof files are
downloaded (if necessary), and the indices of matching profiles are
determined from the Sprof file.
This required a change in all functions and scripts that call function
select_profiles. The previous call signature was
function [profiles,floats] = select_profiles(lon_lim,lat_lim,...
    start_date,end_date,varargin)
The new call signature is
function [float_ids, float_profs] = select_profiles(lon_lim,lat_lim,...
    start_date,end_date,varargin)
That is, the previous second return value is now the first return value.
Instead of a global profile index (the previous first return value) there
is now a cell array with per-float profile indices as the second return
value. This cell array can be used directly as value for the
'float_profs' key in variable arguments in calls to functions
show_trajectories, show_profiles, show_sections, load_float_data and
get_lon_lat_time.
The total number of matching profiles can be computed with, e.g.:
num2str(sum(cellfun('length',float_profs)))
The p2f and fprofid members of global Sprof were deleted.

The Float.wmoid array is now stored as numbers instead of strings.

The Sprof.date array is now stored as the original date strings, so
to get the previous format (Matlab datenum, i.e., days since 1/1/0000),
the values need to be converted with the datenum function, e.g.:
datenum(Sprof.date(profile_ids), 'yyyymmddHHMMSS')
This call can be used to retrieve the datenum values for selected floats:
[~, ~, date] = get_lon_lat_time(floats, float_profs);
An example for finding profiles for a specific month can be found in
main_workshop.m

initialize_argo.m has some sections rearranged, so that all user-specific
settings are at the beginning of the function in a clearly delineated block.

show_profiles, show_sections, show_trajectories:
The first argument must always be an array of float IDs.
Variable option 'type' is obsolete and will be ignored. Subsets of
profiles can be specified with the 'float_profs',float_profs key/value option.
main_workshop.m was updated to show the revised way of calling these functions.
The 'png' option can be used to create png files of all plots.

show_trajectories has a new option 'position' with possible values 'first' or
'last' to show only the first or last position of each specified float.
It also has a new option 'title' that allows the user to specify a custom
title for the plot (default is "Float trajectories").

select_profiles now allows the selection of floats and profiles (in addition
to lon/lat/time and sensor) by 'ocean' ('A', 'P', or 'I') and 'mode'
('R' = real time, 'A' = adjusted, 'D' = delayed mode; any combination
of these can be used).

qc_filter is a new function that can be used to filter variables by their
QC flags. It takes the Data structure that was returned from load_float_data
and returns an equivalent Data structure with the QC flags applied.
